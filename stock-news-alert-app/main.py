## STEP 1: When STOCK price increase/decreases by 5% between yesterday and the day before yesterday then print("Get News").
STOCK_DATA_EXIST =  True

while STOCK_DATA_EXIST:
    # obtain the respective dates and save them as variables
    today_date = dt.now().date()

    yesterday_date_str = str(today_date - timedelta(days=1))

## STEP 2: Instead of printing ("Get News"), actually get the first 3 news pieces for the COMPANY_NAME.

        print(news_list[0])


    STOCK_DATA_EXIST = False
